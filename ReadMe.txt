In the process of making this web application, I started off by studying the designs and choosing which one I felt that I would use out of all the designs. After settling upon one, I began to structure the html and css files with placeholder in the html file with false data just for the case of replicating the design. After I was able to replicate it, I was able to just delete the false data and fill it by running a search on Davis's weather as default when the web page opened.

One thing that I did alter in the design is that I included the desciptions of the weather that was provided to us by Yahoo. I did this instead of putting the precipitation percentage and wind speeds because we were only given data for the first day and not the rest. I thought it would look better without having "N/A" for each day other than the current day describing the rain and wind data. In addition, I believe that having the description is better because to some people, the icons may be subjectively interpretted, so explicitly stating what the weather will give the users a more accurate interpretation of what the weather is like. 

I did place the functions to change the svg icons in the "View" object. However, I did not place the data from Yahoo into a "Model" obejct. I named it "forecast" instead. I assigned a forecast to corresponding objects of days. Through that, I passed each object into functions that would alter each day's data given the data. 

In addition, I did not include the homepage in the design, because the program specifications were to default to Davis's forecast, so I skipped straight to a default five day weather forecast for Davis. 

In the format of the date, I had to format it correctly so it would display as close to the design as possible. The data given to us by Yahoo was "date month year". Since the design wanted "month day", I reversed the ordering of the words and I removed the year. However, some months that are too long are abbreviated.
